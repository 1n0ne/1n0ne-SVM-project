# 1n0ne-SVM-project
This project aims to build an AI agent to recognize 
handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms. The 
agent will extract the handwritten text from an image and 
classify it into their respective digit labels using a machine learning module trained upon the MNIST dataset by the 
SVM algorithm.

you will find in this repository 5 files
first: HandWritten_Recognition.py
which is the SVM model & preliminary test vai a number pic from 0 to 9 I attached the numbers pic in testnumber folder

second: testing.py file which is contain a small handwriting application  developed by python using pygame library and skimage library, The application facilitates users to write numbers on the screen to be predicted by the module

finally: the REPORT.pdf which is a detailed project report
