# 1n0ne-SVM-project
This project aims to build an AI agent to recognize 
handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms. The 
agent will extract the handwritten text from an image and 
classify it into their respective digit labels using a machinelearning module trained upon the MNIST dataset by the 
SVM algorithm.
